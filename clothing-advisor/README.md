It aims to enhance the user experience by offering tailored outfit recommendations that suit individual preferences and requirements.

## User Inputs

- **Style (Classic/Casual/Trendy)**: Matches the user's aesthetic and lifestyle preferences.
- **Fabric (Cotton/Silk/Wool/Any)**: Optional preference to refine recommendations further.

## Data Flow

1. **Form Submission**: The user fills out the form on the webpage and submits it.
2. **Data Collection**: The JavaScript event listener on the form submission collects the input data.
3. **Generate Recommendations**: The collected data is passed to the `generateRecommendations` function, which filters through a simulated database of outfits based on the inputs.
4. **Display Recommendations**: The filtered recommendations are then displayed to the user in the designated section of the webpage.
